                Dependable code; your mother could read.<br/>

                I am passionate about finding elegant solutions. <br/> 
                <br/>
                Completely tested, thoroughly documented, comprehensive, and reusable code.
                Testing starts before coding, and continues throughout development.
                Documenting for the co-worker in 4 years who has to update legacy code.
                Coding solutions that scale efficiently, and solve the problems the client didn't know they had.
                Abstraction wherever feasible, to prepare for inevitable feature requests a week before we go to Production. <br/>
                I can translate between devs and the rest of the team.  I am fluent in 'designer', 'project manager', and 'finance guy'. <br/>
                <br/>
                Front-end work allows me to channel my creativity. 
                Back-end work challenges me to find efficient solutions.

                      Music is in my blood.<br/>

                      Music is my favorite form of expression. <br/>
                      <br/>
                      I always have a song in my head... and I'm usually humming it.
                      I'm a fan of any sound that makes me feel something. 
                      Across all genres, I love music that inspires emotion.
                      The Black Keys when I get home from work, the Arctic Monkeys on Friday nights, and Cage the Elephant on the weekends.
                      <br/>
                      I love making music because I can create the sounds that make me, and anyone listening, feel awesome.
                      Playing guitar has always been my favorite, but I've also been playing bass and piano for awhile.
                      My favorite guitar, with all due respect to my other fabulous guitars, is my Fender Strat.<br/>
                      <br/>
                      My favorite genre is Alternative Rock, and my favorite band is The Strokes. I'm always down to jam.

                  Cars fascinate me; I love to drive.<br/>
                  Formula 1 and Rally fan; Subaru owner.<br/>

                  Cars are the best. <br/>
                  <br/>
                  I drive a Subaru Impreza WRX Premium 2.5L Flat 4, and I love it.<br/>
                  Harnessing explosive power into rotational torque, throwing me back in my chair, and making my passengers grab the "oh shit" handle. 
                  There is something about rowing gears and sniffin gasoline that I just can't get enough of.
                  Working on my car is always a challenge ... I'm no mechanic, I'm just a car nerd ... but I love getting under there and figuring out how everything works.<br/>
                  <br/>
                  The idea of a dude going 100MPH through a tight corner, or getting completely sideways around a dirt road, is infinitely intriguing.  
                  I'm a big fan of Daniel Riccardo and the Red Bull Formula 1 team, and most Sunday mornings I can be found watching F1 during the season.
                  I am also into World Rally Cross; I root for Seb Ogier and the Ford team (of course).

                Boston Sports are my Religion.<br/>
                The Red Sox are the best Baseball team in the world.<br/>
                The Patriots are the best Football team in the world.<br/>
                The Bruins are the best Hockey team in the world.<br/>
                I refuse to listen to any other opinions.

              <div class="content" id="content4">
                I grew up just outside Boston, Massachusetts.<br/>
                <br/>
                If you've never been to Boston (which you should, it's a beautiful city), then you wouldn't know how ingrained the sports culture is there.
                It's completely illogical, but if I meet a Yankees fan, my first impression of them won't be good.
                Every kid has a favorite Sox player, every Monday is dedicated to talking about the Pats game. 
                When the Bruins or Celtics are in the playoffs, the city doesn't sleep.<br/>
                <br/>
                Growing up in that environment, was the best. But, I developed an unexplainable connection to those teams.  
                When the Sox aren't playing well, or the Pats lose at the last second, it physically hurts.
                But when the Pats win (another) Super Bowl, or the Sox are top in the AL East, I'm through the roof.<br/>
                <br/>
                That's the magic.

                At heart, I'm a nerd.<br/>
                I love space travel, super heros, and video games.<br/>
                I'm pumped about AI, ML, and autonomous vehicles. <br/>
                I'm always excited by new software, new hardware, or new technology in general.<br/>
                I entered the computer science field because I genuinely love this stuff. <br/>

                Being a nerd is great.<br/>
                <br/>
                I don't have any misconceptions, I'm a geek.
                I've had an embarassing amount of arguments about who would win if Batman and Ironman fought.
                I love to play Counter Strike with my friends, and go to esports tournaments to root for my favorite teams.
                <br/>
                But I think what makes me a nerd is my passion for technology and the prospects of the future.
                Innovations in space travel will lead to a better understanding of how life is created.
                Progress in artificial intelligence and machine learning will impact every aspect of our lives.
                I think that's worth obsessing over, a little bit.
